# m5backend-azure-pipeline
Backend for Turners insurance, deployed to Azure Web Apps hosting via Github Actions workflow.

This is a collaboration of the "Air Jordans," our amazing Christchurch based team for the Mission Ready Advanced Software course.

Payment functionality is currently disabled on deployed version. 

Visit https://mission5-frontend.web.app/ to test out quote generating functionality through the frontend UI, or
to run locally, just clone, 'npm install' and 'npm start' both this repo and "https://github.com/nicsel88/m5-turners-frontend" in nodejs. 
If you're keen to pay us... (lol, it's only a dummy account with Stripe API) just email and we can forward you .env keys.
